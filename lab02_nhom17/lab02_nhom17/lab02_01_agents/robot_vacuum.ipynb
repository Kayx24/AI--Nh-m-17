Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square in the room has been cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.\n",

For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size and the layout of the room (i.e., it knows $n$). To start, the agent is placed on a random square.\n",

    "If the assignment was to easy for yuo then you can think about the following problems. These problems are challenging and not part of this assignment. We will learn implementation strategies and algorithms useful for these tasks during the rest of the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Obstacles:__ Change your simulation environment to run experiments for the following problem: Add random obstacle squares that also trigger the bumper sensor. The agent does not know where the obstacles are. Perform experiments to observe how this changes the performance of the three implementations. Describe what would need to be done to perform better with obstacles. Add code if you can. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Agent for and environment with obstacles:__ Implement an agent for an environment where the agent does not know how large the environment is (we assume it is rectangular), where it starts or where the obstacles are. An option would be to always move to the closest unchecked/uncleaned square (note that this is actually depth-first search).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Utility-based agent:__ Change the environment for a $5 \\times 5$ room, so each square has a fixed probability of getting dirty again. For the implementation, we give the environment a 2-dimensional array of probabilities. The utility of a state is defined as the number of currently clean squares in the room. Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 100000 time steps. To do this, the agent needs to learn the probabilities with which different squares get dirty again. This is very tricky!"
